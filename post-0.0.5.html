        <h3 class="text-center">Steamworks Developer</h3>
        <p>As an update on the business side of things, I have taken some steps towards 
            making my game come a little closer to reality.

            This has been done with two things:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I am officially a Steamworks developer:
                    <img src="assets/steamworks-dev.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am also officially an owner of my own business:
                        <strong> GreatColtini Industries </strong>
                    <img src="assets/ontario-business-owner.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
                </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h3 class="text-center">Steam Page</h3>
        <p>In addition, I have begun working on my Steam page for my game.
            It's mostly just placeholder for now, but here is a sneak peek at what it looks like:
            <img src="assets/steam-page.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">

            I also requested commissioned art for the steam page, as there is a lot of specific requirements
            and I wanted someone who had experience making steam pages to create the assets.

            You can see on the right-hand side one of the capsules created - so all of the logo/assets 
            for the game were handmade. 

            <br> I am very grateful for the work done, and very pleased with the results!

      <section class="content-section">
        <h3 class="text-center">UI Adjustments</h3>
        <h4> Character Selection </h4>
        <p> I have been making adjustments to the character selection screen,
            and this is the newest layout:
            <img src="assets/char_selection.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">

            <br>

            I had two goals in mind when making these changes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Have space for providing specific character class details
                </li>
                <li>
                    Present many character options at once without it being too cluttered
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>
            In-game UI
          </h4>
          <p>
            Next up for the UI is the in-game portion. Here, I have added in a passive ability tracker.
            This tracker will show you what passive abilities you have unlocked and how many slots you have.
