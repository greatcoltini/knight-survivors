      <section class="content-section">
        <h3 class="text-center">Steamworks Developer</h3>
        <p>As an update on the business side of things, I have taken some steps towards 
            making my game come a little closer to reality.

            This has been done with two things:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I am officially a Steamworks developer:
                    <img src="assets/steamworks-dev.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am also officially an owner of my own business:
                        <strong> GreatColtini Industries </strong>
                    <img src="assets/ontario-business-owner.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
                </li>
            </ol>

            There were a lot more steps than I had anticipated, and a lot more random hurdles to overcome.
            Mostly, it came down to a bunch of small things such as needing a business credit card if I wanted to release the game under a business,
            or filling out forms for selling a game in the US from Canada.
            But I'm glad that I got it done, and it's one more step to my intention of releasing this year!
          </p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h3 class="text-center">Steam Page</h3>
        <p>In addition, I have begun working on my Steam page for my game. It's mostly just placeholder for now, but here is a sneak peek at what it looks like:</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-4">
            <img src="assets/steam-page.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
        </div>

        <p>I also requested commissioned art for the Steam page, as there are a lot of specific requirements, and I wanted someone with experience creating Steam page assets to handle it.</p>
        <p>You can see on the right-hand side one of the capsules created. All of the logos and assets for the game were handmade:</p>
        <div class="text-center mb-4"></div>
            <img src="assets/library-hero.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
        </div>

        <p>I am very grateful for the work done and very pleased with the results! Below are some additional art pieces they created, along with the sketch I provided them:</p>
        <div class="row text-center">
            <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
          <img src="assets/library-capsule.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Library Capsule">
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 mb-4">
          <img src="assets/steam-page-2.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Library Hero">
            </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h3 class="text-center">UI Adjustments</h3>
        <h4> Character Selection </h4>
        <p> I have been making adjustments to the character selection screen,
            and this is the newest layout:
            <img src="assets/char_selection.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">

            <br>

            I had two goals in mind when making these changes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Have space for providing specific character class details
                </li>
                <li>
                    Present many character options at once without it being too cluttered
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>
            In-game UI
          </h4>
          <p>
            Next up for the UI is the in-game portion. Here, I have added in a passive ability tracker.
            This tracker will show you what passive abilities you have unlocked and how many slots you have.
          </p>

      <section class="content-section">
        <h3 class="text-center"> Gameplay Changes </h3>

        <h4> Weapon Format</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Two regular upgrades, enhancing some basic stats of the weapons.</li>
            <li>Two unique upgrades, adding special effects or changing the way the weapon works.</li>
            <li>One legendary upgrade, requiring a specific number of upgrades to have been selected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> New Weapons </h4>
        <p>
            Dagger: a rapid fire weapon that automatically fires in the direction the player is facing.
            <img src="assets/legendary-knives.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
            <ul>
                <li> Dagger Pierce: each point in this upgrade allows the dagger to pierce one more target. </li>
                <li> Dagger Damage: each point in this upgrade increases the damage of the dagger. </li>
                <li> <span style="color: blue;">Poison Daggers</span>: each point in this upgrade increases the poison damage dealt by the dagger, dealing damage over time to a target.</li>
                <li> <span style="color: blue;">Hidden Dagger</span>: This upgrade provides a 25% chance that a dagger will additionally fire from behind.</li>
                <li> <span style="color: purple;">Fan of Knives</span>: The dagger upgrades to fire 5 projectiles at once.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Ice Spikes: a weapon that fires a cone of ice shards, freezing any enemies touched.
            <img src="assets/ice-spikes.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Steamworks Developer">
            <ul>
                <li>Ice Spikes Damage: Increases the damage done by the ice spikes by 0.5 </li>
                <li>Ice Spikes Duration: Increases the duration for which enemies are frozen.</li>
                <li><span style="color: blue;">Coldsnap:</span> Upon thawing, enemies shoot out shards of ice dealing damage.</li>
                <li><span style="color: blue;">Frostbite:</span> Enemies are slowed after unfreezing, increased by 10% per level.</li>
                <li><span style="color: purple;">Ice Storm:</span> Creates a storm of ice around the player, freezing everything in your vicinity</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h4> Legendary Weapons</h4>
        <p>
            Following a similar pattern to Swarm and Vampire Survivors, I wanted to add in special upgrades
            to each of the weapons, rewarding players for levelling the weapons up repeatedly.

            Currently, some weapons (the Ice Spikes and the Dagger) - but in the future all weapons - have 
            legendary upgrades which greatly improves their capabilities.
