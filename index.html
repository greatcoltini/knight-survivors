        <h1 style="text-align:center"> Intro </h1>

        <p> It's been a long time since I've made a post, and 
            I felt like the best way to convey the changes would be to use some format
            that allows me to incorporate both words and images.
            <br><br>
            This may not be a permanent format, but I would like to try to 
            document my changes in a more interesting way, and a blog post seemed like 
            it might be a decent method.
        
        </p>

             I've been working away steadily on Lone Survivor, and I'm hoping to have some kind of release in this year.

        <h3> Gameplay </h3>

        <h4> Objectives </h4>
        <p> 
          I've reworked the objective system - which doesn't change any look from the
          outside, but it makes it a lot more feasible for me to develop future objectives.
          <figure class="figure">

               Elite Objective
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        </p>

        <h4> Abilities </h4>

        <figure class="figure flex-fill m-0">
          <img src="assets/unlockables.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Descriptive Alt Text">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
              Unlockable Weapons
          </figcaption> </figure>
        <figure class="figure flex-fill m-0">

        <p> 
          For abilities, I'm transitioning from a class-based approach to a more generic approach
          like done in Vampire Survivors. 

          My thought process for this is that it will allow for more variety in each playthrough,
          the players will not be limited to using X abilities with Y class, but instead
          have the option to mix and match different abilities as they see fit.

          That being said, there will still be some ability differences, which leads into my next
          headline of...
        </p>

        <h4> Classes </h4>

        <p>
          Currently, there are four classes, of which each will have distinct features.

          My philosophy behind the classes is the following:
          <ol>
            <li> Each class should play around some unique feature or be otherwise distinct </li>
            <li> Each class should have a unique way of survival -> in this case regaining health </li>
            <li> Each class should have access to unique meta-progression upgrades </li>
            <li> Each class should be able to access some kind of survival ability </li>
          </ol>

          That being said, for this version nothing really changes about the classes.
          Builder and Mage currently have no survival mechanisms.

                Builder - Timed turrets
            </figcaption> </figure>
          <figure class="figure flex-fill m-0">

          The builder's turrets however are now functioning on a timer, so you cannot simply
          camp in a corner without having to replace turrets.
        </p>

        <h3> Level Design </h3>
        <h4> Maps </h4>
        <p>
            For maps, I've purchased three asset packs for three separate environments.
            I was hesitant to do this at first, but I felt that these assets 
            aligned well with my vision of what I wanted to do for the levels.
        </p>

        <p>
            I haven't finished the level design yet, and it's something that I struggle with,
            but here is some visuals to look at for them:
            <div class="d-flex gap-3">
              <figure class="figure flex-fill m-0">
                <img src="assets/dungeon.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Descriptive Alt Text">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                    Dungeon
                </figcaption> </figure>
              <figure class="figure flex-fill m-0">
                <img src="assets/grasslands.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Descriptive Alt Text">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                   Grasslands
                </figcaption> </figure>
            </div>
        </p>

        <p>
          Long-term, the plan for the levels is to have one unique endless level and one unique 
          campaign level for each environment type. 
          The idea for the levels is that the campaign level will have structured objectives to complete - 
          still maintaining the simplicity of a survivor game but objectives such as:
          <ul>
            <li> Move to a specific location </li>
            <li> Stay in a specific zone for a while </li>
            <li> Survive for X seconds </li>
            <li> Kill X elite enemies </li>
            <li> Kill the boss </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4> 
          Events
          <img src="assets/event-title.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" style="text-align: center" alt="Descriptive Alt Text">
        </h4>
        <p> To start with events, I've added a new system where over time
            different types of events will occur during the player's survival
            experience.

            <div class="d-flex gap-3">
              <figure class="figure flex-fill m-0">
                <img src="assets/wave-event.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Descriptive Alt Text">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                    Wave Event - where bats spawn on a path
                </figcaption> </figure>
              <figure class="figure flex-fill m-0">
                <img src="assets/swarm-event.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Descriptive Alt Text">
                <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                   Grasslands
                </figcaption> </figure>
            </div>

            These events will eventually be more diverse, but currently we have
            three unique events.
            <ol>
              <li> Swarm: Enemies rapidly spawn near the player using the current enemy pool</li>
              <li> Wave: Flying enemies spawn on a directed path, travelling through the player's given position </li>
              <li> Circle: A cirlce of enemies spawn around the player with high HP, trapping them </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        
        <h3> User Interface </h3>

        <h4> Character and Level Selection </h4>
        <figure class="figure">
            <img src="assets/selection-screen.gif" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Descriptive Alt Text">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                Animation and Live footage of the class + level selection
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> I've made another design change to the character 
            and level selection screens. I've opted to separate
        the selections for level and character to allow for 
        more space to present each idea separately.
         </p>

         <p>

          Moving on to the unlockables screens, I've added 
          some changes to both the weapons and the enemies,
          they currently look like below (still WIP):
